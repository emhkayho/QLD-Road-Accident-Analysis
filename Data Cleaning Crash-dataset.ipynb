    "Our Data Cleaning steps:\n",
    "Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset. Here are some general steps we will follow when performing the data cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Identify the data quality issues: We start by exploring the data to identify any data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, or inconsistent formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Remove duplicates: If we find duplicate records in the dataset, we remove them to avoid overrepresentation of certain data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handle missing values: We will Decide how to handle missing values, whether by imputing them with a reasonable estimate, deleting the entire record or column, or keeping them as missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Standardize data format: We will Standardize the format of your data to ensure consistency, for example, by converting data to a common data type or unit of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Document data cleaning steps: Keep track of the steps we have taken during data cleaning, so that others can understand how we have processed the data and reproduce our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these general steps(not in particular order), we can perform effective data cleaning that will help us get better insights from your data"
